`pycvodes <https://github.com/bjodah/pycvodes>`_ provides a
`Python <http://www.python.org>`_ binding to the
`Ordinary Differential Equation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation>`_
integration routines from `cvodes <https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/description/description.html#descr_cvodes>`_ in the
`SUNDIALS suite <https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html>`_. ``pycvodes`` allows a user to numerically integrate
(systems of) differential equations. Note that routines for sensitivity analysis is not yet exposed in this binding (which makes
the functionality essentially the same as cvode). 

The following multistep methods are available:

- ``bdf``: Backward differentiation formula (of order 1 to 5)
- ``adams``: implicit Adams method (order 1 to 12)

Note that bdf (as an implicit stepper) requires a user supplied
callback for calculating the jacobian.

You may also want to know that you can use ``pycvodes`` from
`pyodesys <https://github.com/bjodah/pyodesys>`_
which can e.g. derive the Jacobian analytically (using SymPy). Pyodesys also provides
plotting functions, C++ code-generation and more.

Documentation
-------------
Autogenerated API documentation for latest stable release is found here:
`<https://bjodah.github.io/pycvodes/latest>`_
(and the development version for the current master branch are found here:
`<http://hera.physchem.kth.se/~pycvodes/branches/master/html>`_).

Installation
------------
Simplest way to install is to use the `conda package manager <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_:

::

   $ conda install -c conda-forge -c bjodah pycvodes pytest
   $ python -m pytest --pyargs pycvodes

tests should pass.

Binary distribution is available here:
`<https://anaconda.org/bjodah/pycvodes>`_

Source distribution is available here:
`<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycvodes>`_

When installing from source you can choose what lapack lib to link against by setting
the environment variable ``PYCVODES_LAPACK``, your choice can later be accessed from python:

.. code:: python

   >>> from pycvodes import _config
   >>> _config.env['LAPACK']  # doctest: +SKIP
   'lapack,blas'

If you use ``pip`` to install ``pycvodes`` note that you will need to install sundials
(and its development headers, with cvodes & lapack enabled) prior to installing pycvodes.

Examples
--------
The classic van der Pol oscillator (see `examples/van_der_pol.py <examples/van_der_pol.py>`_)

.. code:: python

   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> from pycvodes import integrate_predefined  # also: integrate_adaptive
   >>> mu = 1.0
   >>> def f(t, y, dydt):
   ...     dydt[0] = y[1]
   ...     dydt[1] = -y[0] + mu*y[1]*(1 - y[0]**2)
   ... 
   >>> def j(t, y, Jmat, dfdt=None, fy=None):
   ...     Jmat[0, 0] = 0
   ...     Jmat[0, 1] = 1
   ...     Jmat[1, 0] = -1 - mu*2*y[1]*y[0]
   ...     Jmat[1, 1] = mu*(1 - y[0]**2)
   ...     if dfdt is not None:
   ...         dfdt[:] = 0
   ...
   >>> y0 = [1, 0]; dt0=1e-8; t0=0.0; atol=1e-8; rtol=1e-8
   >>> tout = np.linspace(0, 10.0, 200)
   >>> yout, info = integrate_predefined(f, j, y0, tout, atol, rtol, dt0,
   ...                                   method='bdf')
   >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   >>> series = plt.plot(tout, yout)
   >>> plt.show()  # doctest: +SKIP
